# simple-language-training-and-generate-text
This repository contains code for training a language model using TensorFlow. The model is built using a sequential architecture with an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and a dense layer with softmax activation. This code can serve as a starting point for language modeling tasks and natural language processing projects.
